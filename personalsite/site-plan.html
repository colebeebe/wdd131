Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

                Hello, I'm Cole Beebe-Urbanawiz.
                Originally from Idaho, I'm now living with my wife and baby in the Atlanta area.
                I enjoy expressing my creativity through passion projects.
                When I'm not working on these projects, I'm usually spending time with my daughter or playing video games.
            </p>
			<h3>Projects</h3>
			<p>
                <h4>Voxel-Style Rendering Engine</h4>
                <p>
                    Written in C# and utilizing the OpenGL mappings provided by OpenTK, this is an engine that has been in development for nearly half a year.
                    As of yet, it is capable of rendering millions of blocks at a sustainable 1500+fps.
                    The purpose of this project is to explore 3D rendering pipelines.
                </p>
                <h4>Wii Portable</h4>
                <p>
                    A complete trim and relocation of many components of a Nintendo Wii console.
                    This project included lots of micro-soldering and extreme precision.
                    The console can run for about three hours on battery, and played anywhere.
                </p>
                <h4>Atari Asteroids/Moonlander Arcade</h4>
                <p>
                    This project was created using the Godot game engine.
                    It recreates the arcade versions of Asteroids and Moonlander.
                    The purpose of this project was to learn more about game development.
                </p>
            </p>
